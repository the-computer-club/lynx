# Contribution Quick start

Lynx does not contain any inputs. It utilizes module loading mechanisms to provide variables such as `pkgs`.

Lynx does not contain:
  - Source code for your project (We'll host your build instructions though)
  - Nixos Configurations (Share your modules with us instead)
  - Overlays (They're just cursed at scale.)
  - Does not use `self` (flake modules isolated)
